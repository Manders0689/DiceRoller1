# DiceRoller1

This app is a dice roller app and simulates rolling 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided dice.
You click on the button of the die you want to roll and a random die image between 1 and the highest die face will be shown on screen.

I created this app as a learning to as I navigate through programming with the Kotlin language and learn how to work in Adroid Studio.

* Add sounds as the dice are being rolled.
